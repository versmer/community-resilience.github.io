# community-resilience
About
  Climate change increases the unpredictability and severity of extreme weather events. Cities suffer from climate hazards such as flooding, rainstorms, droughts, coastal erosion, and heatwaves. Thus, there is a need for resiliency thinking that acknowledges that change is inevitable and the attempts to resist the change cannot be successful. People should be working with the environment and not against it. The characteristic of a resilient city is the ability to absorb disturbance while undergoing change and still retain its functions.

  There is not so much dispute over achieving resiliency among the general public, people want to lower the climate anxiety and have access to clean energy, but it gets politicized. Thus, there is a need for a bottom-up approach and community-led development. 

  Communities need to understand how resilience and energy transition work to implement solutions. Even if those changes are incremental, changing communities with marginal impacts may be more effective in the long run. 

   The platform will focus on the variety of responses that communities may implement themselves. All over the world, communities are already applying resiliency solutions, and we want to increase their visibility by providing collaborative management tools. For instance, communities may collaborate to reuse materials for projects in different neighborhoods. We need storytelling about how communities are already achieving resilience, and the platform will showcase impactful projects. We plan to start by gathering evidence and mapping communities that already had achievements in the following areas: 
Self-sufficient communities and access to renewable energy
Flood protection with nature-based solutions
Urban heat mitigation strategies
